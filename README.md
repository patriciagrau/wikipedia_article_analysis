# Wikipedia article analysis

This repository contains the code for the master's thesis on Wikipedia Article Analysis, by Patricia Grau Francitorra.

- The folder "scripts" contain the different scripts created. 
- The folder "testing_scripts" contains test files that were created to see if the scripts worked. 
- The folder "jupiter" was a test used to learn how to work with html files and requests. 
- The folder "gold_standard" contains manually annotated files that will be the gold standard for the UD evaluation. 
- The folder "results" contains the results of the script "udparsing_all_languages.py".
- "exploratory_analysis" is a notebook where I test most things.
- "notes" is a markdown file where I write notes/a diary about what I do and the problems I encounter.
